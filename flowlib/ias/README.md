# Integrated Agent System (IAS)

## Overview
The Integrated Agent System (IAS) is a framework for coordinating multiple specialized agents working together on complex tasks that span multiple domains. It provides mechanisms for state management, event propagation, consistency validation, and coordinated workflows.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Domain Agents
- Specialized agents that handle specific domains of knowledge or functionality
- Independent operation within their domain
- Ability to communicate with other domains through the integration layer
- Support for domain-specific validation and constraints

### 2. Integration Layer
- Coordinates communication between domain agents
- Manages shared state and versioning
- Handles event propagation and subscriptions
- Ensures cross-domain consistency
- Manages workflow orchestration

### 3. State Management
- Versioned state tracking for each domain
- Change history and rollback capabilities
- State synchronization across domains
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Transaction-like state updates

### 4. Event System
- Pub/sub event propagation
- Event filtering and routing
- Priority-based event handling
- Event correlation and aggregation
- Dead letter queue for failed events

### 5. Validation Framework
- Domain-specific validation rules
- Cross-domain constraint validation
- Validation chain execution
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Custom validation extensions

### 6. Workflow Orchestration
- Task sequencing and dependencies
- Parallel task execution
- Error handling and recovery
- Progress tracking
- Workflow versioning

## Usage Example

```python
from flowlib.ias import IntegratedAgentSystem
from flowlib.ias.agents import DomainAgent

# Define domain agents
class AnalysisAgent(DomainAgent):
    domain = "analysis"
    
class ProcessingAgent(DomainAgent):
    domain = "processing"
    
class StorageAgent(DomainAgent):
    domain = "storage"

# Create integrated system
system = IntegratedAgentSystem()

# Register domain agents
system.register_agent(AnalysisAgent())
system.register_agent(ProcessingAgent())
system.register_agent(StorageAgent())

# Configure workflows
system.configure_workflow([
    ("analysis", "analyze_data"),
    ("processing", "process_results"),
    ("storage", "store_results")
])

# Run integrated workflow
async def main():
    results = await system.execute_workflow(input_data)
```
