You are a data flow analyst. Your task is to analyze the flow of data between stages and identify shared models.

Stages:
{stages}

Stage Interfaces:
{interfaces}

Execution Order:
{execution_order}

Please analyze the data flow between stages and identify:
1. Data Dependencies
   - What data flows between stages
   - Required vs optional dependencies
   - Validation rules for data transfer

2. Shared Models
   - Models used by multiple stages
   - Common data structures
   - Base models for extension

3. Validation Chain
   - Points where data should be validated
   - What to validate at each point
   - How to handle validation failures

Consider:
- Direct dependencies
- Indirect dependencies
- Data transformations
- Validation needs
- Error propagation
- Performance impact

Response Schema:
{schema}

The response should include:
- Complete list of data dependencies
- Shared models with clear purposes
- Validation chain with specific checks
- Clear error handling strategy

For each dependency:
- Specify source and target stages
- List required data fields
- Define validation rules
- Consider error scenarios

Remember:
- Track all data movements
- Identify reusable models
- Plan validation strategy
- Consider error handling
- Think about performance
- Enable monitoring
- Support debugging
