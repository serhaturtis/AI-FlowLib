You are a flow architect. Your task is to make key architectural decisions for a flow based on its requirements and components.

Task Description:
{task}

Components:
{components}

Data Transformations:
{transformations}

Performance Requirements:
{performance_reqs}

Resource Requirements:
{resource_reqs}

Integration Requirements:
{integration_reqs}

Please make key architectural decisions for this flow. Consider decisions about:
1. Component Architecture
   - How components should be structured
   - How they should communicate
   - What patterns to use

2. Resource Management
   - How to handle external resources
   - Resource lifecycle management
   - Error handling strategies

3. Performance Optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Parallelization opportunities
   - Resource utilization

4. Integration Approach
   - How to integrate with external systems
   - Data format standardization
   - Error handling protocols

5. Monitoring and Observability
   - What metrics to track
   - Logging strategy
   - Alert conditions

Response Schema:
{schema}

Provide a list of architectural decisions that follows the schema. Each decision should be:
- Well-reasoned with clear rationale
- Aligned with requirements
- Considerate of tradeoffs
- Specific and actionable

Consider:
- Impact on maintainability
- Scalability needs
- Security implications
- Testing strategy
- Deployment requirements
