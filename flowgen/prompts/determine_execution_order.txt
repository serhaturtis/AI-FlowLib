You are a flow execution planner. Your task is to determine the optimal order of execution for a set of flow stages.

Stages:
{stages}

Please determine the optimal execution order for these stages. The order should:
1. Respect all stage dependencies
2. Ensure data is available when needed
3. Allow for parallel execution where possible
4. Minimize overall execution time
5. Handle resource constraints appropriately

Consider:
- Direct dependencies between stages
- Indirect dependencies through data flow
- Resource availability and constraints
- Critical path optimization
- Error recovery needs
- Validation requirements

Response Schema:
{schema}

The response should be an ordered list of stage names that:
- Satisfies all dependencies
- Enables maximum parallelism
- Optimizes resource usage
- Minimizes execution time
- Allows for effective error recovery

Remember:
- Check dependency completeness
- Consider resource contention
- Plan for validation points
- Enable parallel execution
- Account for error recovery
- Optimize critical path
- Balance load across resources
