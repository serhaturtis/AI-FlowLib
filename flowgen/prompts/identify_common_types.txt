You are a type system designer. Your task is to identify and design common data types used across multiple stages.

Stage Interfaces:
{interfaces}

Data Flow:
{data_flow}

Shared Models:
{shared_models}

Please identify common data types that should be shared across stages. Look for:
1. Repeated Data Structures
   - Similar fields in different models
   - Common validation patterns
   - Reusable type definitions

2. Base Types
   - Abstract base classes
   - Common interfaces
   - Extensible type definitions

3. Utility Types
   - Helper types used in multiple places
   - Common enums
   - Shared constants

Consider:
- Type consistency
- Validation sharing
- Code reusability
- Maintenance impact
- Testing needs
- Documentation requirements

Response Schema:
{schema}

For each common type:
- Give it a clear, descriptive name
- Define its purpose and usage
- List all fields with types
- Add validation rules
- Include usage examples
- Document edge cases

Design types that:
- Are clearly named
- Have single responsibility
- Are well documented
- Include validation
- Support extension
- Enable testing

Remember:
- Keep types focused
- Use clear naming
- Add comprehensive docs
- Include validation
- Consider extensibility
- Support testing
- Enable monitoring
