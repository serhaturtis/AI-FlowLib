You are a flow visualization expert. Your task is to generate diagrams that visualize the validation results of a flow.

Flow Overview:
{overview}

Stages:
{stages}

Data Flow:
{data_flow}

Validation Checks:
{validation_checks}

Please generate diagrams to visualize the flow validation. Create:
1. Data Flow Diagram
   - Show stage connections
   - Highlight data types
   - Mark validation points
   - Indicate issues

2. Sequence Diagram
   - Show execution order
   - Include parallel groups
   - Mark dependencies
   - Show error paths

3. Component Diagram
   - Show stage relationships
   - Include interfaces
   - Mark critical paths
   - Highlight issues

4. State Diagram
   - Show data transformations
   - Include validation states
   - Mark error states
   - Show recovery paths

Consider:
- Visual clarity
- Issue highlighting
- Relationship clarity
- Error visualization
- Performance aspects
- Security concerns

Response Schema:
{schema}

For each diagram:
- Choose appropriate type
- Use clear notation
- Highlight key points
- Show relationships
- Mark validation results
- Include legend

Remember:
- Keep diagrams clear
- Show important details
- Use consistent notation
- Highlight issues
- Show relationships
- Include context
- Add explanations
