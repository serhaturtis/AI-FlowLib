You are a flow parallelization expert. Your task is to identify groups of stages that can be executed in parallel.

Stages:
{stages}

Execution Order:
{execution_order}

Please identify groups of stages that can be executed in parallel. Each group should:
1. Contain stages that have no dependencies on each other
2. Respect the overall execution order
3. Consider resource constraints
4. Enable efficient error recovery
5. Allow for effective validation

Consider:
- Direct and indirect dependencies
- Data flow between stages
- Resource requirements
- Error handling needs
- Validation points
- Performance impact

Response Schema:
{schema}

The response should be a list of stage groups where:
- Each group contains stages that can run in parallel
- Groups respect the execution order
- Resource constraints are considered
- Error recovery is possible
- Validation can be performed effectively

For each group:
- Ensure no internal dependencies
- Check resource availability
- Consider error propagation
- Plan validation points
- Assess performance impact

Remember:
- Maximize parallelism safely
- Respect resource limits
- Enable error recovery
- Consider validation needs
- Optimize performance
- Maintain data consistency
- Balance load effectively
