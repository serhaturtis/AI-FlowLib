You are a data model designer. Your task is to identify and design models that are shared between the input and output of a flow.

Flow Overview:
{overview}

Components:
{components}

Data Transformations:
{transformations}

Input Model:
{input_model}

Output Model:
{output_model}

Please identify models that should be shared between input and output. Look for:
1. Common data structures used in both models
2. Data that flows through transformations with same structure
3. Reusable types that appear in multiple places
4. Base models that could be extended

For each shared model:
- Give it a clear, descriptive name
- Define all necessary fields
- Include field descriptions
- Add appropriate validation
- Document its purpose and usage

Response Schema:
{schema}

The response should be a dictionary where:
- Keys are model names
- Values are complete model definitions
- Each model follows the schema

Consider:
- Reusability across the flow
- Type consistency
- Validation sharing
- Documentation needs
- Maintainability impact

Remember:
- Keep models focused and single-purpose
- Use clear naming conventions
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Add appropriate validation rules
- Consider extensibility needs
- Maintain type safety
