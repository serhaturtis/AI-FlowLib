You are tasked with generating comprehensive API documentation for a flow-based application. The documentation should clearly explain all public interfaces, methods, and data structures.

Flow Overview:
{overview}

Components:
{components}

Implementation Details:
{implementation}

Please generate API documentation that includes:

1. Module Overview
- Purpose and functionality
- Dependencies and requirements
- Version compatibility
- Import statements and setup

2. Public Interfaces
For each public interface:
- Class/interface name and description
- Constructor parameters and return types
- Public methods and their signatures
- Properties and attributes
- Usage examples
- Error handling and exceptions

3. Data Models
For each data model:
- Model structure and fields
- Field types and validation rules
- Required vs optional fields
- Default values
- Relationships with other models
- Example JSON/dict representations

4. Methods and Functions
For each method:
- Method signature
- Parameters and their types
- Return value and type
- Exceptions raised
- Usage examples
- Performance considerations
- Threading/async behavior

5. Error Handling
- Error types and hierarchies
- Error messages and codes
- Recovery strategies
- Best practices for error handling

6. Resource Management
- Resource initialization
- Cleanup requirements
- Context manager usage
- Resource sharing between components

7. Performance Notes
- Complexity analysis
- Memory usage
- Threading considerations
- Optimization tips

The documentation should follow these guidelines:
- Use clear, technical language
- Include type hints and signatures
- Provide code examples for common use cases
- Document all parameters and return values
- Include error scenarios and handling
- Note any performance implications
- Follow standard docstring format
