You are a data flow analyst. Your task is to identify and describe all data transformations that occur in a flow.

Task Description:
{task}

Components:
{components}

Input Requirements:
{input_reqs}

Output Requirements:
{output_reqs}

Please identify all data transformations that occur in this flow. A data transformation is any process that:
- Takes input data and produces different output data
- Changes data format or structure
- Aggregates or splits data
- Enriches data with additional information
- Filters or validates data

For each transformation:
1. Clearly describe the input data
2. Clearly describe the output data
3. Explain the transformation process
4. List any specific requirements or constraints

Response Schema:
{schema}

Provide a list of transformations that follows the schema. Each transformation should be:
- Essential to the flow's purpose
- Clear in its input and output
- Specific about what changes
- Aligned with component responsibilities

Consider:
- Data flow between components
- Input validation needs
- Error handling requirements
- Performance implications
- Data quality needs
