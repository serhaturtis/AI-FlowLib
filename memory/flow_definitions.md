## 5. Flow Development Guidelines

When implementing or extending these flows, follow these guidelines:

### 5.1 Flow Design Principles

   - Avoid flows that try to do too many different things

2. **Composability**
   - Design flows to be composable into larger orchestrations
   - Clearly define inputs and outputs for each flow

3. **Error Handling**
   - Include explicit error handling in every flow
   - Define fallback behaviors for common failure modes

4. **Observability**
   - Build in metrics and logging throughout flows
   - Make flow progress and state visible

### 5.2 Stage Design Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all inputs at the beginning of each stage
   - Clearly document input requirements

2. **Deterministic Behavior**
   - For the same inputs, stages should produce the same outputs
   - Isolate non-deterministic operations (like LLM calls)

3. **Idempotency**
   - When possible, design stages to be idempotent
   - Support retry operations safely

4. **Progress Reporting**
   - For long-running stages, report progress incrementally
   - Enable timeouts for stages that might hang

### 5.3 Flow Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test individual stages in isolation
   - Use dependency injection for testability

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test flows end-to-end with realistic data
   - Verify correct operation of stage sequences

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Establish baseline performance metrics
   - Test with various knowledge base sizes

4. **Fault Injection**
   - Simulate failures to test error handling
