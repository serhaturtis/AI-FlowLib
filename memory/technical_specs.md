# Memory System Design: Technical Specifications

## 1. Overview

The Memory System is the foundation of the Learning/Teaching Agent, providing dual storage mechanisms that complement each other: a Vector Memory for semantic similarity search and a Graph Memory for structured entity-relationship queries. Together, they enable both fuzzy semantic matching and precise relationship traversal, giving the system a much richer understanding capability than either approach alone.

## 2. Dual Memory Architecture

### 2.1 Vector Memory

#### 2.1.1 Purpose
The Vector Memory stores knowledge as semantic embeddings, enabling the system to:
- Retrieve information based on conceptual similarity
- Support fuzzy matching for imprecise queries
- Discover related concepts that may not share explicit relationships
- Handle natural language variations in how concepts are expressed

#### 2.1.2 Technical Components
- **Embedding Generation**: Converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors
- **Vector Database**: Stores and indexes embeddings for efficient similarity search
- **Similarity Search Engine**: Retrieves vectors based on cosine similarity or other distance metrics
- **Chunking System**: Breaks knowledge into appropriate-sized fragments for embedding
- **Metadata Storage**: Maintains additional information about each vector entry

#### 2.1.3 Data Structure
Each vector entry contains:
```
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "vector": [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.n],  // high-dimensional embedding
  "text": "Original text that was embedded",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "document-id or conversation-id",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "version": 2,
    "domain": "biology",
    "tags": ["protein", "enzyme", "cellular-function"]
  }
}
```

#### 2.1.4 Performance Requirements
- Support for at least 100,000 vector entries
- Query response time under 100ms for top-10 similarity matches
- Support for filtered queries based on metadata attributes
- Ability to add new vectors without rebuilding entire index

### 2.2 Graph Memory

#### 2.2.1 Purpose
The Graph Memory stores knowledge as structured entities and typed relationships, enabling the system to:
- Retrieve precise information about specific entities
- Traverse relationship paths between entities
- Execute complex queries about multi-step relationships
- Maintain a structured view of the knowledge domain

#### 2.2.2 Technical Components
- **Entity Store**: Manages nodes representing concepts, objects, or facts
- **Relationship Store**: Manages typed edges connecting entities
- **Graph Query Engine**: Executes traversals and pattern matching queries
- **Schema Manager**: Maintains ontology and type information
- **Property Store**: Manages attributes of both entities and relationships

#### 2.2.3 Data Structure
Each entity contains:
```
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "type": "entity-type",
  "name": "Human-readable entity name",
  "properties": {
    "property1": "value1",
    "property2": "value2"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "document-id or conversation-id",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "version": 1,
    "domain": "biology"
  }
}
```

Each relationship contains:
```
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "type": "relationship-type",
  "source_id": "entity-id-1",
  "target_id": "entity-id-2",
  "properties": {
    "property1": "value1"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "document-id or conversation-id",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "version": 1,
    "domain": "biology"
  }
}
```

#### 2.2.4 Performance Requirements
- Support for at least 1,000,000 entities and 5,000,000 relationships
- Query response time under 200ms for 3-hop graph traversals
- Support for complex filtering on entity and relationship properties
- Ability to update entity and relationship properties without rebuilding the graph

### 2.3 Integration Layer

#### 2.3.1 Purpose
The Integration Layer coordinates interactions between the Vector Memory and Graph Memory, enabling:
- Unified querying across both systems
- Cross-validation of information
- Metadata synchronization
- Consistent versioning

#### 2.3.2 Technical Components
- **Query Orchestrator**: Coordinates search across both memory systems
- **Result Merger**: Combines and ranks results from both systems
- **Consistency Manager**: Ensures metadata consistency between systems
- **Confidence Aggregator**: Combines confidence scores from multiple sources

#### 2.3.3 Common Metadata Structure
Both memory systems share a common metadata structure:
```
{
  "source": {
    "type": "document|conversation|inference",
    "id": "source-identifier",
    "url": "optional-url",
    "title": "optional-title",
    "author": "optional-author"
  },
  "temporal": {
    "created": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "modified": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "expires": "optional-expiration-timestamp"
  },
  "confidence": {
    "score": 0.0-1.0,
    "reasoning": "explanation for confidence score",
    "factors": {
      "source_reliability": 0.0-1.0,
      "consistency": 0.0-1.0,
      "specificity": 0.0-1.0,
      "recency": 0.0-1.0
    }
  },
  "versioning": {
    "version": "version-number",
    "previous_version": "previous-version-id",
    "change_reason": "reason for update"
  },
  "usage": {
    "access_count": 42,
    "last_accessed": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "usefulness_score": 0.0-1.0
  },
  "domain": {
    "primary": "primary-domain",
    "secondary": ["domain1", "domain2"],
    "context": "specific context where this knowledge applies"
  }
}
```

## 3. Confidence Scoring System

### 3.1 Components

#### 3.1.1 Source Reliability Assessment
- Evaluates the credibility of information sources
- Assigns base confidence based on source type
- Considers author expertise and publication venue

#### 3.1.2 Consistency Checker
- Compares new information with existing knowledge
- Identifies conflicts and corroborations
- Adjusts confidence based on agreement with other knowledge

#### 3.1.3 Specificity Analyzer
- Assesses how precise and detailed the information is
- Differentiates between specific facts and general statements
- Assigns higher confidence to more precise information

#### 3.1.4 Temporal Relevance Evaluator
- Considers the age of information in time-sensitive domains
- Assigns higher confidence to recent information
- Identifies potentially outdated knowledge

### 3.2 Confidence Calculation Algorithm

The system calculates confidence using a weighted formula:

1. **Base Score** = Source_Reliability (0.0-1.0)
2. **Adjustments**:
   - Consistency_Multiplier (0.5-1.5)
   - Specificity_Factor (0.7-1.2)
   - Temporal_Relevance (0.5-1.0)
3. **Final Score** = min(Base_Score * Consistency_Multiplier * Specificity_Factor * Temporal_Relevance, 1.0)

### 3.3 Confidence Evolution

Confidence scores are not static but evolve over time:
- Increased when information is confirmed by additional sources
- Decreased when contradictory information is discovered
- Decayed over time for time-sensitive domains
- Updated when source reliability assessments change

## 4. Versioning System

### 4.1 Components

- Assigns version numbers to knowledge entries
- Maintains history of changes
- Tracks relationships between versions

#### 4.1.2 Change Detector

- Determines when a new version should be created
- Records the nature of the change

#### 4.1.3 Conflict Resolver
- Manages conflicting versions of the same knowledge
- Decides which version to prioritize
- Maintains alternative versions with their confidence scores

#### 4.1.4 Snapshot Generator
- Creates point-in-time snapshots of the knowledge base
- Enables reverting to previous states if needed
- Provides historical contexts for analysis

### 4.2 Versioning Schema

Each version includes:
```
{
  "version_id": "unique-version-identifier",
  "entity_id": "identifier of versioned entity/relationship",
  "version_number": 3,
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "author": "agent-id or user-id",
  "previous_version": "previous-version-id",
  "change_type": "update|create|merge|split|deprecate",
  "change_description": "Human-readable description of changes",

  "diff": {
    "added": { /* properties added */ },
    "removed": { /* properties removed */ },
    "modified": { /* properties modified with before/after */ }
  }
}
```

### 4.3 Version Retrieval

The system supports several version retrieval modes:
- **Latest Version**: Returns most current version (default)
- **Version by Number**: Returns specific version by number
- **Version by Date**: Returns version active at a specific time
- **Version History**: Returns the complete version history
- **Diff Between Versions**: Returns differences between versions
